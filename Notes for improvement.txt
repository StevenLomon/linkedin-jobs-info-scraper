The company link in the right side bar is not always clickable How does it show up in the JSON request result?
The keywords search can give a lot of results: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ssab/people/?keywords=CMO%20OR%20Chief%20of%20Marketing%20OR%20Head%20of%20Marketing%20OR%20Marknadschef%20OR%20Marketing%20Director
Try to match the keywords to the bio the best we can
Let's put the keywords from the front end in a list
FRONT END: "CMO, Chief of Marketing, Head of Marketing, Marknadschef, Marketing Director, Vice President Marketing"
LINKEDIN QUERY: "CMO%20OR%20Chief%20of%20Marketing%20OR%20Head%20of%20Marketing%20OR%20Marknadschef%20OR%20Marketing%20Director%20OR%20Vice%20President%20Marketing"
LINKEDIN: "CMO OR Chief of Marketing OR Head of Marketing OR Marknadschef OR Marketing Director OR Vice President Marketing"

The list becomes: more_than_list = more_than_keywords.split(", ") -> ['CMO', 'Chief of Marketing', 'Head of Marketing', 'Marknadschef', 'Marketing Director', 'Vice President Marketing']
This guys's bio: Director Marketing at SSAB Europe
This code is GOLD: is_present = any(title in linkedin_bio for title in over_threshold_list)
And I need to add 'Director Marketing' bcuz of this silly guy :]
This weeds away the majority of people
And I also need to make sure we're comparing lowercase:
over_threshold_list = over_threshold_keywords.lower().split(", ")
is_present = any(title in linkedin_bio.lower() for title in over_threshold_list)
If more than 2 (if that is what we put into the front end)? Pick the top 2 cuz it seems like there is a semblence of sorting based on keyword match

This is a truly interesting case that breaks my full name cleaning function: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicklas-hafner-fd-johansson-60233741/

I need to make sure the odd case where the query result on the company page that gives 0 results doesn't break the program.
This is a case where no one matches: https://www.linkedin.com/company/begreen-sverige/people/?keywords=CEO%20OR%20VD%20OR%20Founder
I also need to make sure that this returns an empty list and that it doesn't break the program, i.e. in the for result in grouped_results
part of the code, I need to make sure that if the results tuple with employee info is empty, we just continue so that we don't
insert it into the dataframe

I really don't see how Hiring Team could crash. I just need to make sure it works. Let's get to it!

This is truly fucking weird. If a company is of a certain size, their api_request_url will include additional parameters
outside of the company id that is separate for each company. I am not bothering with these, so let's just pray that
they have a hiring team like SAAB! And if they don't, they're probably not interested anyway

A potential improvement depending on specifications:
# Splitting keywords by spaces to allow partial matches within the bio
for keyword in keywords_list:
    # Creating a list of key phrases to match against the bio
    key_phrases = keyword.split(" ")
    if all(phrase.lower() in bio for phrase in key_phrases):
        processed.append(("FALSE", full_name, bio, linkedin_url_result))
        break  # Break the loop once a match is found to avoid duplicating the same person for multiple keywords
